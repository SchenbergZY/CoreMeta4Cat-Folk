# CoreMeta4Cat

**CoreMeta4Cat** is a shared metadata standard for catalysis research developed under [NFDI4Cat](https://www.nfdi4cat.de/). At its core, it answers questions that come up whenever catalysis datasets need to be shared, compared, or reused: *what information does a dataset need to include to be understood by someone outside your group?*

CoreMeta4Cat defines that minimum set of information — which fields are required, which are recommended, and which are optional — across four data classes: Synthesis, Characterization, Reaction, and Simulation. It builds on [DCAT-AP+](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/) and [ChemDCAT-AP](https://nfdi-de.github.io/chem-dcat-ap/), and draws its terminology from [Voc4Cat](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat/), NFDI4Cat's controlled vocabulary for catalysis.

## Metadata Checker Tool

The most up-to-date list of CoreMeta4Cat metadata fields for all four research domains — Synthesis, Characterization, Reaction, and Simulation — is available as a structured Excel workbook:

[⬇ Download the metadata list](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/CoreMeta4Cat/latest/assets/coremeta4cat_vocabulary.xlsx)

Each domain lists its fields grouped by priority (Mandatory, Recommended, Optional), with plain-language descriptions and links to controlled vocabulary terms where available. This is the right starting point if you want to understand what metadata your dataset should include.

We are currently developing a user-friendly **Metadata Checker** tool that will make this process even easier — upload your dataset, and the tool will automatically identify which required fields are present, which are missing, and give you a plain-language gap report with a downloadable template to act on. No schema knowledge required. The tool will be available here soon.

## The four research domains

CoreMeta4Cat covers four domains of catalysis research. Each defines its own set of Mandatory, Recommended, and Optional metadata fields.

| Domain | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis** | How a catalyst is prepared — precursors, preparation method, process conditions, and measured properties |
| **Characterization** | How a catalyst is analysed — technique, instrument, sample, and method-specific parameters |
| **Reaction** | How a catalytic experiment is run — reactor type, reactants, conditions, and product identification |
| **Simulation** | How a computational study is performed — software, method, conditions, and calculated properties |

Full field listings: [Synthesis](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/CoreMeta4Cat/latest/synthesis/) · [Characterization](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/CoreMeta4Cat/latest/characterization/) · [Reaction](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/CoreMeta4Cat/latest/reaction/) · [Simulation](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/CoreMeta4Cat/latest/simulation/)

## Vocabulary reference workbook

A structured Excel overview of all metadata fields — grouped by domain, colour-coded by Mandatory / Recommended / Optional — is available at [`docs/assets/coremeta4cat_vocabulary.xlsx`](docs/assets/coremeta4cat_vocabulary.xlsx).

This file is **generated automatically from the schema** and is intended as a reference and starting point, not a data entry form. The schema is the authoritative source; the workbook reflects it.

## Schema architecture

CoreMeta4Cat is implemented as a modular [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) schema:

```
coremeta4cat.yaml              ← top-level aggregator + CatalysisDataset
  └── coremeta4cat_common.yaml          ← shared slots and enumerations
        ├── coremeta4cat_synthesis_ap.yaml       ← Synthesis + preparation methods
        ├── coremeta4cat_characterization_ap.yaml ← Characterization + techniques
        ├── coremeta4cat_reaction_ap.yaml        ← Reaction + reactor types
        └── coremeta4cat_simulation_ap.yaml      ← Simulation + methods
```

The schema generates Python datamodels, OWL ontology, JSON-LD, and TypeScript representations automatically.

## Developer tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Dependency management and virtual environments |
| [just](https://github.com/casey/just) | Command runner — run `just` to list all available recipes |
